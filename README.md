# Game-of-Life

Required C# version 8.0 or later. 
I used B2/S23 rule and Moore's neighborhood overview.

Implemented feateres: 
-- You're able to choose population's density. To do so, you need to pause game, choose desired parameter and press "generate again" button
-- You're able to slow picture updates with corresponding button.
-- You're able to draw patterns and erase them in real-time by yourself! Just use left and right mouse button respectively

If you want to take a look at result, just run Game-of-Life.exe file 

Hope you'll enjoy it, if so leave a star ^_^
